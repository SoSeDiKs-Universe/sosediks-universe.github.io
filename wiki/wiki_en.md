## {% href_link 🔗 | Introduction %}

### {% href_link ❓ | What's this thingy? :O %}
We are a small friendly community trying to make the gameplay of `Minecraft`{: .mc-gold} somewhere more difficult, somewhere easier, in general more diverse and interesting.

You may find various server changes and new content by exploring this wiki.

In short, the main gameplay of the server is to build your own world. Each {% symlink player, Player %} has their own personal permanent world, into which you can bring resources from other non-permanent worlds. Friends can visit each other's worlds and survive together. Many different obstacles await you on the way to the develop your personal world.

The server is in the open `alpha`{: .mc-gold} testing phase*¹, various bugs and shortcomings are possible.

\*¹ Actually, the open alpha phase is endless, there will never be a release. Thus, no wipes are planned in the future!



### {% href_link 👾 | Discord %}
The main activity between the {% symlink player, Players %} takes place in our 👾 [Discord]({{site.discord_invite}}){: .discord} server.

Among other things, it features:
- A single linked chat between Discord and the Minecraft server.

- Changelog of server updates.
- List of known bugs.
