### {% href_link ðŸ›¶ | Jumpy Boats %}
You can jump while riding a {% symlink oak_boat_entity, Boat %}! This allows you to easily get your {% symlink oak_boat_entity, Boat %} to the shore from the water or climb up slabs/stairs.

If used carefully, it can also save your {% symlink oak_boat_entity, Boat %} from drowning or help you float upstream against the current in difficult situations.

### {% href_link ðŸš‚ | Better minecarts %}
- Moving {% symlink minecart_entity, Minecarts %} can damage entities on the tracks.
- {% symlink minecart_entity, Minecarts %} are bounced back on contact with {% symlink slime_block, Slime Blocks %} and {% symlink slime, Slimes %}.
