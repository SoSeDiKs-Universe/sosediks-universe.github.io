### {% href_link ðŸ›¶ | Jumpy Boats %}
You can jump while riding a {% symlink oak_boat_entity, Boat %}! This allows you to easily get your {% symlink oak_boat_entity, Boat %} to the shore from the water or climb up slabs/stairs.

If used carefully, it can also save your {% symlink oak_boat_entity, Boat %} from drowning or help you float upstream against the current in difficult situations.
