## {% href_link 🔧 | Mechanics %}

### {% href_link 🛠️ | Disabled item break %}
Tools no longer disappear after breaking, unless they have a `«Curse of Vanishing»`{: .mc-red}. An item with zero durability remains in the inventory but cannot be used to perform its function until it is repaired.

### {% href_link 🌬️ | Bottled Air %}
When filling {% symlink glass_bottle, Glass Bottles %} with water underwater, the bottles replenish some air.

Drinking water underwater automatically refills an empty bottle, turning it into a {% symlink water_potion, Water Bottle %}. The same applies to crafts that give out empty bottles as a result.

If you hold a hot item in your other hand, the bottle will not refill with water, but may burst.

### {% href_link 🌈 | Immersive Dyes %}
Dyes can be applied onto dyeable placed blocks with {% game_action use %}.

Dyes can be applied onto dyeable items in {% symlink item_frame, Item Frames %} with {% game_action use %}.

{% symlink shulker_open, Shulkers %} can be dyed.

When possible, {% symlink paper, Paper %} will remove the color.

There's 8% chance that the dye will be removed upon use.

Most dyeing recipes were removed.

### {% href_link ♨️ | Immersive tools %}
Some tools like {% symlink clock, Clocks %}, {% symlink lunar_clock, Lunar Clocks %}, {% symlink compass, Compasses %}, {% symlink depth_meter, Depth Meters %}, {% symlink thermometer, Barometers %}, {% symlink thermometer, Thermometers %}, {% symlink speedometer, Speedometers %}, and {% symlink luxmeter, Luxmeters %} show detailed info in lore, optionally on screen, and when interacted.

Additionally, F3 debug screen no longer displays information like coordinates if the player doesn't carry all the aforementioned tools.

### {% href_link ✨ | «Fire Aspect» acts as Flint and Steel %}
`«Fire Aspect»`{: .mc-aqua} enchantment allows using the item as a {% symlink flint_and_steel, Flint and Steel %}.
This also includes an {% symlink enchanted_book, Enchanted Book %} with a stored enchantment, though it also sets the user on fire for 3 extra seconds.

### {% href_link 🥔 | Eternal Children %}
Feeding a {% symlink poisonous_potato, Poisonous Potato %} to a child will make it lose the opportunity to grow up.



## {% href_link 🧩 | Miscellaneous %}

### {% href_link ✂️ | Don't run with scissors! %}
{% symlink shears, Shears %} inflict damage when attempting to run with them in your hand.

### {% href_link 🔥 | Flint and Steel ignites entities %}
Using {% symlink flint_and_steel, Flint and Steel %} on a mob while sneaking or crawling will set it on fire.

### {% href_link 🕯️ | Lit items ignite surroundings %}
Attacking mobs with lit {% symlink torch, Torches %} (of any kind), {% symlink campfire, Campfires %}, or other burning items (including `«Fire Aspect»`{: .mc-aqua} enchantment, enchanted or stored) will set it on fire.

Lit items can also burn {% symlink cobweb, Cobwebs %} via {% game_action use %}.

### {% href_link 🪏 | Better Shovels %}
Flowers and replaceable blocks no longer prevent {% symlink dirt_path, Dirt Path %} creation.

{% symlink dirt_path, Dirt Paths %} and {% symlink farmland, Farmland %} can be converted into {% symlink dirt, Dirt %} by using a {% symlink wooden_shovel, Shovel %} on them while sneaking. The {% symlink wooden_shovel, Shovel %} will lose durability with a 10% chance.

Using ({% game_action use %}) a {% symlink wooden_shovel, Shovel %} on a {% symlink snow_block, Snow Block %} will remove a layer from it, dropping a {% symlink snowball, Snowball %}.

### {% href_link 🧑‍🌾 | Better Hoes %}
Flowers and replaceable blocks no longer prevent {% symlink farmland, Farmland %} creation.

Using ({% game_action use %}) a {% symlink wooden_hoe, Hoe %} on grown crops will break the crops and replant the seed if the crop has dropped its seed or the player has seeds of the same crop in their offhand or hotbar.

### {% href_link 🤺 | Piercing blow %}
Items can now attack through grass and other vegetation. If the item is a melee weapon, the targeted block won't be insta broken.

### {% href_link 📖 | Readable books in item frames %}
{% symlink writable_book, Books %} placed in {% symlink item_frame, Item Frames %} can be read with {% game_action use %}.

### {% href_link 📓 | Book formatting preview %}
You may preview the {% symlink writable_book, Book's %} formatting (i.e., how the book would look after signing) by using {% game_action use %} while sneaking.

### {% href_link 🫗 | Bottle retrieval %}
Bottled items (e.g. {% symlink potion, Potions %}, {% symlink honey_bottle, Honey Bottle %}, etc.) can be turned into an empty {% symlink glass_bottle, Glass Bottle %} when placed in a crafting grid. Being underwater will produce a {% symlink water_potion, Water Bottle %} instead.

### {% href_link 🪣 | Fragile Buckets %}
Buckets come in various materials (yes, including {% symlink chainmail_bucket, Chainmail Bucket %}) and have durability.

### {% href_link 🔥 | Hot items %}
Some items are considered "hot" and may interact with gameplay mechanics, such as {% symlink gloves, Gloves %} or bottled air.

The following items are considered hot:
- {% symlink lava_bucket, Lava Bucket %}
- {% symlink blaze_powder, Blaze Powder %}
- {% symlink blaze_rod, Blaze Rod %}
- {% symlink fire_charge, Fire Charge %}
- {% symlink magma_block, Magma Block %}
- {% symlink magma_cream, Magma Cream %}
- {% symlink campfire, Lit Campfire %}
