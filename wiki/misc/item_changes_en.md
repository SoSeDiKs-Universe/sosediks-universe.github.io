## {% href_link 🔧 | Mechanics %}

### {% href_link 🛠️ | Disabled item break %}
Tools no longer disappear after breaking, unless they have a `«Curse of Vanishing»`{: .mc-red}. An item with zero durability remains in the inventory but cannot be used to perform its function until it is repaired.

### {% href_link 🌬️ | Bottled air %}
When filling {% symlink glass_bottle, Glass Bottles %} with water underwater, the bottles replenish some air.

Drinking water underwater automatically refills an empty bottle, turning it into a {% symlink water_potion, Water Bottle %}. The same applies to crafts that give out empty bottles as a result.

If you hold a hot item in your other hand, the bottle will not refill with water, but may burst.

### {% href_link 🌈 | Immersive dyes %}
Dyes can be applied onto dyeable placed blocks with {% game_action use %}.

Dyes can be applied onto dyeable items in {% symlink item_frame, Item Frames %} with {% game_action use %}.

{% symlink shulker_open, Shulkers %} can be dyed.

When possible, {% symlink paper, Paper %} will remove the color.

There's 8% chance that the dye will be removed upon use.

Most dyeing recipes were removed.

### {% href_link ♨️ | Immersive tools %}
Some tools like {% symlink clock, Clocks %}, {% symlink lunar_clock, Lunar Clocks %}, {% symlink compass, Compasses %}, {% symlink depth_meter, Depth Meters %}, {% symlink thermometer, Barometers %}, {% symlink thermometer, Thermometers %}, {% symlink speedometer, Speedometers %}, and {% symlink luxmeter, Luxmeters %} show detailed info in lore, optionally on screen, and when interacted.

Additionally, F3 debug screen no longer displays information like coordinates if the player doesn't carry all the aforementioned tools.

### {% href_link ✨ | «Fire Aspect» acts as Flint and Steel %}
`«Fire Aspect»`{: .mc-aqua} enchantment allows using the item as a {% symlink flint_and_steel, Flint and Steel %}.

### {% href_link 🥔 | Eternal Children %}
Feeding a {% symlink poisonous_potato, Poisonous Potato %} to a child will make it lose the opportunity to grow up.



## {% href_link 🧩 | Miscellaneous %}

### {% href_link ✂️ | Don't run with scissors! %}
{% symlink shears, Shears %} inflict damage when attempting to run with them in your hand.

### {% href_link 🔥 | Flint and Steel ignites entities %}
Using {% symlink flint_and_steel, Flint and Steel %} on a mob while sneaking or crawling will set it on fire.

### {% href_link 🕯️ | Lit items ignite entities %}
Attacking mobs with lit {% symlink torch, Torches %} (of any kind) or {% symlink campfire, Campfires %} will set it on fire.

### {% href_link 🪏 | Better shovels %}
Flowers and replaceable blocks no longer prevent {% symlink dirt_path, Dirt Path %} creation.

{% symlink dirt_path, Dirt Paths %} and {% symlink farmland, Farmland %} can be converted into {% symlink dirt, Dirt %} by using a {% symlink wooden_shovel, Shovel %} on them while sneaking. The {% symlink wooden_shovel, Shovel %} will lose durability with a 10% chance.

Using ({% game_action use %}) a {% symlink wooden_shovel, Shovel %} on a {% symlink snow_block, Snow Block %} will remove a layer from it, dropping a {% symlink snowball, Snowball %}.

### {% href_link 🧑‍🌾 | Better hoes %}
Flowers and replaceable blocks no longer prevent {% symlink farmland, Farmland %} creation.

### {% href_link 🤺 | Piercing blow %}
Items can now attack through grass and other vegetation. If the item is a melee weapon, the targeted block won't be insta broken.

### {% href_link 📖 | Readable books in item frames %}
{% symlink writable_book, Books %} placed in {% symlink item_frame, Item Frames %} can be read with {% game_action use %}.

### {% href_link 📓 | Book formatting preview %}
You may preview the {% symlink writable_book, Book's %} formatting (i.e., how the book would look after signing) by using {% game_action use %} while sneaking.

### {% href_link 🫗 | Bottle retrieval %}
Bottled items (e.g. {% symlink potion, Potions %}, {% symlink honey_bottle, Honey Bottle %}, etc.) can be turned into an empty {% symlink glass_bottle, Glass Bottle %} when placed in a crafting grid. Being underwater will produce a {% symlink water_potion, Water Bottle %} instead.

### {% href_link 🔥 | Hot items %}
Some items are considered "hot" and may interact with gameplay mechanics, such as {% symlink gloves, Gloves %} or bottled air.

The following items are considered hot:
- {% symlink lava_bucket, Lava Bucket %}
- {% symlink blaze_powder, Blaze Powder %}
- {% symlink blaze_rod, Blaze Rod %}
- {% symlink fire_charge, Fire Charge %}
- {% symlink magma_block, Magma Block %}
- {% symlink magma_cream, Magma Cream %}
- {% symlink campfire, Lit Campfire %}
