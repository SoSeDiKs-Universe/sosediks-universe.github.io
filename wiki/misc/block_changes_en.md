## {% href_link 🏞️ | Environmental %}

### {% href_link 🔥 | Campfires can set on fire %}
If someone stands on a lit {% symlink campfire, Сampfire %}, the fire will spread to them. Having `«Frost Walker»`{: .mc-aqua} enchantment on boots makes you exempt, though.



## {% href_link 🔧 | Mechanics %}

### {% href_link 🔔 | Knock-knock and ding-dong %}
{% symlink oak_door, Doors %} and {% symlink oak_trapdoor, Trapdoors %} can be knocked on with {% game_action attack %}. If there is a {% symlink oak_button, Button %} next to them, {% game_action attack %} on it will act as a doorbell.

### {% href_link 🐈 | The cat won't let you open the chest? %}
Opening a {% symlink chest, Chest %} will knock entities on it towards the lid. But be careful! If there is a wall behind the lid or a mob is on the {% symlink chest, Chest %} when the lid is closed, the entity will take one point of damage.

### {% href_link 🚪 | Smart door opening %}
{% symlink oak_door, Doors %}, {% symlink oak_trapdoor, Trapdoors %} and {% symlink oak_fence_gate, Fence Gates %} open together if they are next to each other. This can be prevented by crouching, or in the case of redstone, having a signal below 8.



## {% href_link ⚙️ | Tweaks %}

### {% href_link 🪧 | Better sign editing %}
{% symlink oak_sign, Sign %} editing screen is no longer opened automatically on place.

{% symlink oak_sign, Signs %} keep their text when broken and render it in the inventory. Clicking {% game_action use %} with a {% symlink oak_sign, Sign %} in hand on another placed {% symlink oak_sign, Sign %} will apply the stored text to it. The text can be erased in the crafting grid.

### {% href_link 📦 | Easier access to storage %}
Interacting ({% game_action use %}, without crouching) with {% symlink item_frame, Item Frames %}, {% symlink painting, Paintings %} and {% symlink oak_sign, Signs %} opens the inventory of the block behind them.
