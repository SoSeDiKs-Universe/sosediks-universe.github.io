## {% href_link 🏞️ | Environmental %}

### {% href_link 🔥 | Campfires can set on fire %}
If someone stands on a lit {% symlink campfire, Сampfire %}, the fire will spread to them. Having `«Frost Walker»`{: .mc-aqua} enchantment on boots makes you exempt, though.

## {% href_link 🔧 | Mechanics %}

### {% href_link 🔔 | Knock-knock and ding-dong %}
{% symlink oak_door, Doors %} and {% symlink oak_trapdoor, Trapdoors %} can be knocked on with {% game_action attack %}. If there is a {% symlink oak_button, Button %} next to them, {% game_action attack %} on it will act as a doorbell.

## {% href_link ⚙️ | Tweaks %}

### {% href_link 🪧 | Better sign editing %}
{% symlink oak_sign, Sign %} editing screen is no longer opened automatically on place.

{% symlink oak_sign, Signs %} keep their text when broken and render it in the inventory. Clicking {% game_action use %} with a {% symlink oak_sign, Sign %} in hand on another placed {% symlink oak_sign, Sign %} will apply the stored text to it. The text can be erased in the crafting grid.
