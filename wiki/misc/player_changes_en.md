## {% href_link 🎮️ | Gameplay %}

### 👕 Clothes and gloves
In addition to the usual four armor slots, there are also four visual armor slots for clothing and a slot for {% symlink gloves, Gloves %}.

{% symlink gloves, Gloves %} are required for some actions on the server, such as collecting {% symlink lava, Lava %} in a {% symlink bucket, Bucket %} or safely destroying {% symlink glass, Glass %} with bare hands.

Clothing is worn over armor and serves both for visuals and to help with other aspects of the game, such as {% symlink temperature, Temperature %}.

The {% symlink player, Player %} renders their clothing first, and falls back to armor underneath otherwise.

Since both clothing and armor occupy the same slots, you can switch the preview between armor and clothing in the inventory using {% game_action drop %}.

You can put _any_ item (1 pc.) in the helmet clothing slot. Some items will have functionality when worn this way, such as lighting the way with a {% symlink torch, Torch %}, or allowing other {% symlink player, Players %} to ride on you with a {% symlink saddle, Saddle %}.

### {% href_link 🌊 | Swimming improvements %}
When swimming on the surface of water, air won't be consumed, which allows you to swim quickly without getting out of breath.

When sprinting on the surface of water, you can enter swimming mode, even if the water is one block high.

Ability to jump out of the water onto a block above the water.



## {% href_link 🤝 | Player interactions %}

### {% href_link ❔ | Stealth %}
{% symlink player, Player %} nicknames above them and join/leave messages are hidden.

### {% href_link 🦙 | Spits %}
Similarly to {% symlink llama, Llamas %}, you can*¹ use `/spit`{: .mc-gold} to spit.

{% side_note %}
*¹ Note: sadly, {% symlink ghost, Ghosts %} aren't capable of spitting.
{% endside_note %}

### {% href_link ⛑️ | Teamwork %}
If {% symlink player, Players %} have leather {% symlink leather_helmet, Caps %} or {% symlink leather_chestplate, Tunics %} of the same color, they do not damage each other, and projectiles fly right through.
