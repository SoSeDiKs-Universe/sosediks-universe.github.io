## {% href_link 🤝 | Player interactions %}

### {% href_link ❔ | Stealth %}
Player nicknames above them and join/leave messages are hidden.

### {% href_link 🦙 | Spits %}
Similarly to {% symlink llama, Llamas %}, you can use `/spit`{: .mc-gold} to spit.

### {% href_link ⛑️ | Teamwork %}
If players have leather helmets or chestplates of the same color, they do not damage each other, and projectiles fly right through.
