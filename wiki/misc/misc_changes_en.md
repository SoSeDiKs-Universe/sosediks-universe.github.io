If you sneak while swapping items, only half of the items will go into the other hand.

### {% href_link 🎩 | Blessing on Unbinding %}
`«Curse of Binding»`{: .mc-red} enchantment can be mitigated by having the enhanced `«Weakness»`{: .mc-aqua} potion effect.

### {% href_link ♨️ | Item lore icons %}
{% symlink writable_book, Books %} display their author's online status.

Dyed items display their color as a #hex value.

## {% href_link 🔓️ | Special Abilities %}

These features are locked behind some requirements, like having obtained an advancement.


### {% href_link ✂️ | Shearable Creepers %}
Non-powered {% symlink creeper, Creepers %} can be sheared to neutralize them. This will get rid of its drops too, though, and, well, the {% symlink creeper, Creeper %} itself.
