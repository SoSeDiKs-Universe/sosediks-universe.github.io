## {% href_link 🔗 | Player %}
{% symlink player, Players %} {% wiki_link Player %} were once a very advanced civilization capable of unimaginable things. Nowadays they are believed to be an extinct species.

Players spanned across many parts of the Universe, bringing both joy and destruction on their path.

The ongoing destruction of the Universe is speculated to be related to actions of Players in the past.

After the destruction begun and Players became `wanted`{: .mc-red}, their whole species suddenly disappeared.

<br/>

Possessing, hiding, or having _any_ relations with Players is strictly prohibited by the intergalactic law.

Despite this, the {% symlink wandering_trader, Wandering Trader %} was able to secretly bring back Players into this world.



### {% href_link ❕ | Known abilities %}
#### {% href_link 🧠 | Laziness %}
Players are known to be well skilled in many aspects of life: they've succeeded in biology, cosmology, alchemy, golemancy, magic and many other sciences.

At the peak of their existence, they were capable of destroying whole planets, breaking the undestructible blocks and bringing the undead to life. In fact, many players were higher undead themselves, having the capability of respawning after death.

#### {% href_link 💬 | Communication %}
Players are capable of communicating with each other via some unknown technology*¹ not yet learned by other species of the Universe.

\*¹ Chances are, it's our 👾 [Discord]({{site.discord_invite}}){: .discord}! :)



### {% href_link ❔ | Unknown abilities %}
#### {% href_link 🌀 | Soul Link %}
Thanks to the {% symlink wandering_trader, Wandering Trader %}, Players have the ability to enter and leave our Universe any time they want.

Despite living within this Universe in the past, the coming spirits of Players have little to no knowledge or memories of this world.

While being in a spirit realm, they possess the ability to control golems, undead and living species.
