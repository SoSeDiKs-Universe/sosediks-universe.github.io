{% symlink player, Players %} {% wiki_link Player %} were once a very advanced civilization capable of unimaginable things. Nowadays they are believed to be an extinct species.

`Players`{: .mc-gold} spanned across many parts of the Universe, bringing both joy and destruction on their path.

The ongoing destruction of the Universe is speculated to be related to actions of `Players`{: .mc-gold} in the past.

After the destruction begun and `Players`{: .mc-gold} became `wanted`{: .mc-red}, their whole species suddenly disappeared.

<br/>

Despite this, the {% symlink wandering_trader, Wandering Trader %} was able to secretly bring back `Players`{: .mc-gold} into this world.
