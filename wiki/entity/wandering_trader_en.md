## {% href_link 🔗 | Wandering Trader %}
{% symlink wandering_trader, Wandering Trader %} {% wiki_link Wandering_Trader %}, in spite of usual misconceptions*¹, is a _`single entity`{: .mc-red}_ with God-like powers.

\*¹ The `Wandering Trader`{: .mc-gold} possesses the ability to simultaneously exist in multiple places. While other species with similar or identical looks are all separate mobs, the {% symlink player, Players %} came to the conclusion that all instances of `Wandering Trader`{: .mc-gold} are a sole entity.

### {% href_link ❕ | Known abilities %}
#### {% href_link 🏕️ | Traveling %}
The `Wandering Trader`{: .mc-gold} travels across the Universe, mostly just observing it, collecting random things, and not interfering with how things flow.

Time to time one of the entity's dolls comes to visit {% symlink player, Players %} and offer to trade random things. Killing the dolls seems to not have any changes to the entity's mood nor friendliness towards the {% symlink player, Player %}.

Other species seem to not know about the `Wandering Trader`{: .mc-gold}'s powerful nature.



### {% href_link ❔ | Unknown abilities %}

The reasons behind why the `Wandering Trader`{: .mc-gold} did this are unknown.
